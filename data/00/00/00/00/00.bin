  |   Sparta, 500 BC. The city-state's weapons, armor and gold have         |
  |   mysteriously vanished. Magical portals begin to appear throughout     |
  |   ancient Greece. As a king and the world's most fearsome warrior,      |
  |   Leonidas sets out to discover who is behind the threat, and recover   |
  |   everything that was stolen. You, are King Leo. And your aim is to     |
  |   make whoever is responsible and whatever stands in your way, rue      |
  |   the day they crossed your path.                                       |

  |   * No matter which path you choose, you can always return to any       |
  |     point. Feeling greedy and want to go back and collect all of the    |
  |     coins? No problem! There is no area you cannot return to. But       |
  |     remember to plot your routes and keep track of where you've been,   |
  |     because without retrieving all of the artifacts or chests you       |
  |     won't be able to activate the magical escape portal. Not happy      |
  |     with your score? You can replay any level, any time, once it's      |

  |   * When the margin for error is small, responsive controls are a       |
  |     sheer delight. You command, and King Leo executes with lightning    |
  |     speed. You say "Jump!", and he says "How high?" If your reflexes    |
  |     are fast enough, his reflexes will be fast enough. Every step       |
  |     counts and every move is in your hands                              |
